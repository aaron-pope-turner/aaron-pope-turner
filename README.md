- 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron. I share the same name with the guy who congress looks to for their updateson the cybersecurity world, so I often find myself under attack by his many rivals.
- 👀 I’m interested in 1st and foremost God, and let me be clear... I am woken up and I do not believe anything ay orginized religion claims. In all honesty if there were going to be 2 false prophits, I can tell already they are the religions themselves and those who head them. Im mostly reffering to muslims, islam, and the thousands of varieties of christians. All clam to be or have prophets.... so, Logically that's where you will find the each and evry false one. True prophets aren't labeled as such due to the resistance of conforming to societiest religious delusions.
