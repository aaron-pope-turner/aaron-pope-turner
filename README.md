- 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron. I share the same name with the guy who congress looks to for their updates in the cybersecurity world, so I often find myself under attack by his many rivals.
- 👀 1st and foremost I'm 100% fully enlightened by the definition of enlightment given to us via Buddha. Well he is the closest to exactly what God told me face to face when I briefly died. That being said 90% of my day I'm either interested in meditation and/or anythin and everything to do with what humans refer to as; God, and our higher selves. I want to be crystal clear.... I am awoken in the most spiritual sense of the word, and I do not believe any organized religious claims. In all honesty; if there were going to be 2 False prophets, I can tell you according to the source of everything that is, the Organized religions themselves and those who head them; and Im mostly reffering to muslims, islam, and the thousands of varieties of christians. All claim to be or have prophets.... so, Logically that's where you will find each and evry false one. You have to be a revered Prophet first before you can be deemed a false prophet. True prophets aren't labeled as such due to the resistances in Societies religious delusions.     Besides that im deeply focused on ethical hacking and making it my lifes mission to see to it that scam hackers and the like go extinct.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Foundations of Cybersecurity @Merit America using @Coursera to earn my certs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever my lifes road lays ahead of me. Im hoping to one day develop a system for each and every human on this spaceship we call Earth to be fluent in enterprise level cybersecurity by the end of there junior high grade schooling. I whole heartedly believe that with any and all things internet related, especially because the way things are going these days within the cyber landscape, that no man, woman, or child should be aloud to access all things internet until they can prove they are knowledgable enough to mitigate any malicious attack that may come their way.
